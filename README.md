# PythonBasics
7 Programs in Python for beginners.

1. Create a python program for accepting two integer inputs and return their product if the sum of two numbers is greater than 20 and less than 40; else return the difference if their sum is greater than 40 and less than 60 and return their sum if their sum is greater than 60. 
# Solution -> sum.py

2. Write a python program to input 5 subject marks and calculate total marks, percentage and grade based on following criteria:
• Percentage less than 35 (Grade F)
• percentage greater than or equal to 35 and less than 65 (Grade C)
• percentage greater than or equal to 65 and less than 85 (Grade B)
• percentage greater than or equal to 85 (Grade A) 
# Solution -> marks.py

3. Write a python program to accept a shape as an input. Then according to the shape provided as an input, take the necessary parameters as input and return the perimeter and the area of the shape.
# Solution -> shapes.py

4. Write a python program to check whether a given number is palindrome or not. Also reverse the number and print the output.
# Solution -> palindrome.py

5. Using python print the following pattern as output:
    1
    2 1
    4 2 1
    8 4 2 1
    16 8 4 2 1
    32 16 8 4 2 1
    64 32 16 8 4 2 1
    128 64 32 16 8 4 2 1
The above pattern is the answer when the value of n is 8. Take user input and create a similar pattern for value of n as 5 and 7.
# Solution -> pattern.py
